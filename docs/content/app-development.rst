ABCI

blurb on ABCI, see issue #27

The `ABCI repo <https://github.com/tendermint/abci>`__ has some excellent resources to help you get started. To get acquainted with ABCI and building apps in any language (for which an ABCI server exists) or writing your own server, the following is a logical sequence of information to read through:

- the `README <https://github.com/tendermint/abci/blob/master/README.md>`__ is a great starting point and orients you around the repo and some examples.
- there's an `Introduction to ABCI <http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction.html#abci-overview>`__ in Tendermint's Read the Docs, which provides context for the ABCI
- the `Tendermint 102 Read The Docs <http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/#tendermint-102>`__ is mostly dedicated to the ABCI and ABCI app development
- the above includes a specification, which can also be found `here <https://github.com/tendermint/abci/blob/master/specification.rst>`__.
- there is a section about the ABCI in the `Cosmos Whitepaper <https://cosmos.network/whitepaper#abci-specification>`__, providing additional context.
- TODO, see issue #11
